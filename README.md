OpenShift Container Platform Demos

This repository is for automated OpenShift demonstrations. If the demonstration is not fully automated and comes with proper documentation on how to run the demo, pull requests will be denied.

All demos have to take into account that ovs-multitenant (separation of project communication) may be running.

Put your documentation for your demo here: https://github.com/mglantz/openshift-demos/docs
